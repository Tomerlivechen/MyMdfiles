# Reverse Complement RNA Program

## Description

This program performs various DNA sequence manipulations, including generating the reverse, complement, reverse complement, and RNA sequence of a given DNA sequence.

## Features

- Converts a DNA sequence into its reverse.
- Converts a DNA sequence into its complement.
- Generates reverse complement of a DNA sequence.
- Converts a DNA sequence to RNA (with thymine replaced by uracil).
- Generates reverse complement RNA.

## Installation

To run this program, ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- `Tkinter` (for the graphical interface)

You can install `Tkinter` using your package manager if it's not already available:

```bash
# For Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

## Usage

1. Insert a DNA sequence into the input field.
2. Click the "Run" button to generate the following outputs:
    - Reverse sequence
    - Complement sequence
    - Reverse complement sequence
    - RNA sequence
    - Reverse complement RNA sequence


## User Interface

The program includes a Tkinter graphical interface with the following features:

- **Input field** to enter a DNA sequence.
- **Labels** to display the reverse, complement, reverse complement, RNA, and reverse complement RNA.
- **Run button** to trigger the sequence manipulations.
