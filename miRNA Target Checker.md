# miRNA Target Checker

This project is a Python-based application with a graphical user interface (GUI) for identifying miRNA targets in DNA sequences. It allows users to input DNA sequences and searches for predefined miRNA target patterns, displaying the results in a user-friendly format.

## Features

- **DNA Sequence Input:** Enter any DNA sequence using the input field.
- **miRNA Target Matching:** Counts occurrences of predefined miRNA target sequences.
- **Scrollable Results Display:** Displays matching targets and their occurrences in a scrollable text box.
- **Total Occurrences:** Provides a summary of the total miRNA matches found.

## Technology Stack

- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **Tkinter:** GUI framework used for building the interface.
- **ScrolledText Widget:** To display results in a scrollable format.

## How to Use

1. **Install Python:** Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. **Run the Program:** Execute the script by running:
   ```bash
   python miRNA_checker.py
   ```
3. **Input DNA Sequence:** Enter a DNA sequence in the input field (e.g., `ATGCTGCA`).
4. **Check for miRNA Targets:** Click the "Check Targets" button to search for matches.
5. **View Results:** Matches and their counts will be displayed in the scrollable results box.

## Example Output

**Input:**
```
ATGCTGCAAGGAGGATGTGCAAT
```

**Output:**
```
miRNA Target Occurrences:
ATGCTGCA: 1 occurrences
GAGGAGG: 1 occurrences
Total Occurrences: 2
```
