# Private Programs Documentation

This repository contains documentation for programs I have developed. The source code for these programs remains private, but you can access detailed markdown files describing each program's purpose, functionality, and usage.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:

- Share insights into my projects.
- Provide detailed explanations of program features and their implementations.
- Showcase my work while keeping the source code confidential.

Each markdown file corresponds to a program and contains details such as:

- Program overview.
- Key features.
- Technical specifications.
- Usage instructions.

## Access Policy

- **Markdown Files:** Available for everyone to read.
- **Source Code:** The source code for each program is private and not included in this repository.

If you are interested in the source code for any program, feel free to reach out to discuss potential collaboration or access.

## How to Use

1. Browse the markdown files to learn about each program.
2. Open any `.md` file to view its content.
3. Reach out if you have questions or are interested in learning more about a specific program.
