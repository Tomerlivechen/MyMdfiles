# Exam Simulator Program (WPF)

## Overview

The Exam Simulator Program is a desktop application built using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). It allows teachers to create, store, and manage questions and answers on a central server, which is then used to generate randomized exams for students. The results of the exams, along with detailed feedback on mistakes, are instantly provided to students. The program also stores user data, exam results, and user interactions in a centralized database for review and record-keeping by educators.

## Features

- **Question and Answer Storage**: Teachers can input and store questions and answers on a server database, making them available to all users.
- **Randomized Exam Generation**: Exams are created dynamically by selecting randomized questions from the database, ensuring each student gets a unique exam.
- **Immediate Results**: Upon completing an exam, students receive their results immediately along with a detailed explanation of any mistakes they made.
- **User and Exam Data Storage**: All student performance data, user details, and exam results are stored securely in a database for tracking and review purposes.
- **Teacher and Student Roles**: Different user roles are supported, allowing teachers to create exams and monitor student progress, while students can take exams and view results.
